This contains the Jupyter notebooks used to explore and visualize sea ice variability on subseasonal timescales in S2S forecast models. We are especially interested in extreme sea ice loss on day-to-day timescales, as these daily fluctuations in sea ice loss can be very important to the people who live and work in the Arctic, and to the Arctic ecosystem. Since extreme sea ice loss on day-to-day timescales is often associated with large atmospheric circulation anomalies (e.g. Wang et al. (2020), https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0528.1), we are also interested in the predictability of sea ice during and after these extreme events. This work forms the basis of a manuscript currently in preparation by M.C. McGraw, C.M. Bitz, and E. Blanchard-Wrigglesworth. The main scientific objectives of this work are the following:
*  Understand the seasonal and regional variability of extreme sea ice loss on subseasonal timescales; and evaluate how well forecast models can simulate these seasonal and regional variations;
*  Determine whether or not sea ice extent is <b>MORE</b> predictable or <b>LESS</b> predictable following an extreme sea ice loss event.
